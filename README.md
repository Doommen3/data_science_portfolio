This was a final project completed in a Computational Methods in Statistics (Stat 415) course at Northern Illinois University. The objective of the project was to simulate agricultural yields. 


[Determinants and Consequences of Electrification in India](https://github.com/Doommen3/data_science_portfolio/tree/main/Consequences%20and%20Determinants%20of%20Electrification%20in%20India/Independentstudy_honorsproject)  
Abstract:  

This study examines the effects of village-level electrification on socioeconomic welfare in rural India, with a focus on inequities in access and outcomes. Electrification is widely regarded as a catalyst for development, improving productivity, educational attainment, and income. However, the distribution of these benefits remains uneven. Using cross-sectional data from the Socioeconomic High Resolution Urban Geographic (SHRUG) dataset, this paper investigates the relationship between eelctricity access and estimated monthly consumption per capita, a proxy for welfare.

The analysis employs multiple linear regression to control for factors such as income, poverty rates, gender composition, and land ownership. Results indicate that access to domestic electricity increases estimated monthly consumption by 1.6%, highlighting its positive impact on welfare. However, access to commercial electricity shows no significant effect, underscoring the limited role of electrification in non-agricultural sectors. The findings reveal that higher-income villages are more likely to benefit from electrification, exacerbating existing socioeconomic inequities.

This study contributes to the growing body of literature by offering village-level insights into the determinants and consequences of electrification. Policymakers must address distributional disparities and prioritize targeted strategies-such as integrating gender empowerment and poverty alleviation programs- to ensure equitable access and masximize the developmental benefits of rural electrification.
